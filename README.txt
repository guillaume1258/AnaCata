So far, the metabolite a in WS model represented both energy and processed metabolites. We seek to separate metabolism into two distinct paths: 1 - Catabolism, i.e. Cutting the sugars in order to extract ATP (From glycolysis) & RedOx potential (to eventually produce ATP from respiration). 2 - Anabolism, i.e Molecules are processed into precursor of the cell mass: amino acids, dNTPs, rNTPs, etc.

Respiration requires maintenance of the pH gradient between the exterior/interior of the cell. Exterior would be the periplasmic space for gram-positive bacteria. This is costly as it requires maintenance of the membrane potential.
